Next, in order to train a model the augmented dataset an 80:20 split was applied to the data.

\LST{part\_d1}

The goal of this exercise was to find a \textit{cheap} model capable of achieving at least a $70\%$ validation accuracy. After some experimentation the model able to achieve the stated goal was a single convolution layer with a 5x5 kernel, a max pool layer which decreases the kernel output by a factor of 16, and a linear output layer with 4 neurons for each class. In total the model used only 94 parameters to achieve a best validation accuracy of $0.75\%$.
