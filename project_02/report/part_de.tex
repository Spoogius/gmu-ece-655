\label{sec:sec_de}

Using the learned parameters from Section~\ref{sec:sec_c} the current values in the validation set. The learned regression line is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:learn}. And the validation loss was computed to be $0.001394$ which is reasonably inline with the training loss. It being lower than the training loss can be attributed to the small dataset size and only have 10 validation points.
