\section{Part D}
\label{sec:sec_d}
Next to consider the impact of changing the optimizer the loss was set back to \textbf{MSE} loss and the optimizer was changed to \textbf{Adam}. 

\LST{part\_d}

It can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:d loss} that the curve mains it's exponential shape that it had when using the \textbf{SGD} optimizer but it is approaching convergence much slower.
