\section{Part B}
\label{sec:sec_b}
For learning the regression a single layer linear model was trained using the \textbf{SGD} optimizer, \textbf{MSE} loss, and \textbf{full} batch size. The loss curve is shown in figure~\ref{fig:b loss}. 
For this experiment a learning rate $\mu$ of 0.05 was used and stayed constant for the remainder of this project. As can be seen with the chosen parameters convergence is nearly completed after 20 epochs.
